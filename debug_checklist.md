# Subscription Update Debugging Checklist

## Issue: User profile and subscription table not updating after Paddle payment

### 1. Database State Check

- [ ] Verify subscription plans have correct `paddle_product_id` values
- [ ] Check if user profiles exist in the database
- [ ] Verify RLS policies allow updates
- [ ] Test manual profile updates

### 2. Webhook Function Check

- [ ] Verify webhook is deployed and accessible
- [ ] Check webhook logs for errors
- [ ] Test webhook with mock payload
- [ ] Verify environment variables are set

### 3. Paddle Integration Check

- [ ] Verify webhook URL is correctly configured in Paddle
- [ ] Check if Paddle is sending webhooks
- [ ] Verify webhook signature verification
- [ ] Test with real Paddle events

### 4. Frontend Integration Check

- [ ] Verify user ID is being sent in custom_data
- [ ] Check if profile refresh is working
- [ ] Test manual refresh functionality
- [ ] Verify subscription status display

## Current Status:

- ✅ Webhook function deployed with enhanced logging
- ✅ RLS policies allow all operations
- ✅ Frontend refresh mechanism implemented
- ❓ Database state needs verification
- ❓ Paddle webhook configuration needs verification

## Next Steps:

1. Run database state check
2. Test webhook with mock payload
3. Verify Paddle webhook configuration
4. Test with real payment flow
